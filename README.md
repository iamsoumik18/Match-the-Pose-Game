# Match-the-Pose-Game

This is a simple game made with the help of pygame module. In this game, we have to match the poses of the character in consecutive order. If we do not match the poses by two consecutive clicks, then the first clicked button automatically hides itself. We have to match all the eight different poses in this game. We can quit the game by simply pressing esc key or by clicking the close button.
